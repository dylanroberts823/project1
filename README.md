# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project may not have been possible without extensively reading, learning and using the code spplied by Faaab's (assume he) submission of CS-50w-project1, available here: https://github.com/Faaab/cs50w-project1/blob/master/application.py

Most of the work here is pulled from code Faaab wrote, not in an attempt to take credit for his work, but to learn from what he wrote. For every function he used and I didn't know, I looked it up and learned so much more. If I didn't understand a function, I didn't use it. If you asked me to, I could rewrite something similar to what I produced below on my own. This is what I've learned open-source coding is all about - learning from each others' work, then building upon it to grow and better it as a community.

To be specific about what is mine and what is his: I wrote everything in templates. He inspired the way to hash passwords, and clarified how to use "with" for the import statement.
